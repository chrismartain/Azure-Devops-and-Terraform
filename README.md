# Azure-Devops-and-Terraform

This guide is designed to walk you through the process of deploying a DotNet project to
Azure using Terraform. 
The steps in this project assume that you have already created a DotNet project and 
have access to an Azure account.
Terraform is a popular infrastructure-as-code tool that allows us to define, provision,
and manage infrastructure as code. Azure is a cloud computing platform that provides a 
range of services including virtual machines, databases, storage, and more.
Prerequisites: Before getting started, you will need to have the following:
* A .NET project ready to be deployed
* An Azure account with an active subscription
* Terraform installed on your local machine
* Azure CLI installed on your local machine
* An IDE like Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
